1. Figure out what features to include for X
2. Figure out what we are predicting i.e. what will Y contain (tomorrows close, tomorrows open??? etc.)
3. Figure out best regression model
  - Gaussian RBF?
  - L2 regularised regression?
  - consider what we are trying to determine, robustness to outliers?
4. Figure out a buy/sell strategy
  - for example a simple one would be buy whenever we predict tomorrow's open/close to be higher by certain %


Features:
1. Todays open
2. Prev close
3. Prev volume
4. 15 day ewm
5. prev Open to prev close ratio (% change per day)
6. prev close to to open ratio (% change overnight)
7. % change of volume

Notes:
Current model uses the above features to predict the adj close of the next X=5 number of days
Regression model used is the L2-regularised least squares with the kernel trick
